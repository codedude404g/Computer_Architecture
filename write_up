    • My approach:
+ Use a union object to read float data and convert to int/bit array at the same time
+ Put two mantissas into two unsigned integers, the same for the two exponents.’
+ Adjust the two mantissas so that the two exponents become equal
+ Add two mantissas into an unsigned number. If the exponent is all 1’s, the mantissa become zero (Infinity)
+ Assign all bits of the new mantissa and the new exponent into a float_32 union result variable
+ Print the calculated result and the result from adding two original numbers directly.
    • Degree of success: Passed all the sample testcases.
